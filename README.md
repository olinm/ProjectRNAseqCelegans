# ProjectRNAseqCelegans
This is a Project in Molecular Biology which I am conducting under my studies at Umea University. Its aim is to develop my R and analysis skills by using RNAseq C. elegans data provided by Changchun Chen Lab under the supervision of HenLab's Johan Henriksson.

About the project:
>research on hypoxia in Caenorhabditis elegans and how it manages to resist various oxygen level conditions based on gene expression,
>which genes are involved in the resistance: up- and down-regulation of relevant genes,
>which transcription factors are involved in the response
